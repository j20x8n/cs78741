LSJ 200 Final Assignment 
Law  Society Policy Memo 
(please   note that this assignment may be   updated to   offer additional   clarity)
For your final assignment   in this class, we are asking you to   put   our course   concepts   to   use   and   develop   a   policy   memo on an area of law of your choice. This   assignment will   blend   research,   socio-legal analysis, and   political advocacy together. Your memo should deploy the   analytical tools we   have   been developing together all quarter, including key terminology   and frameworks for   interpreting   policy   impacts.   While your research   may rely   primarily on external sources,   the   strongest   policy   memos will   bring   in major course readings (even ones that aren’t   directly   connected   to   your   research!)   and   concepts   to   help   us   interpret your area of policy.   Remember, one of the skills that we want you   to   work   on   this   quarter   is         drawing connections even when they aren’t so obvious. 
What   policy topics are eligible for this assignment?   Most!   Remember, this is   a   class   on   “law   and   society,”   not just one or the other. The important thing is that   you   can justify your   policy   area   as   being   suitable for         socio-legal analysis. This can include topics that we   have covered   in   class,   or topics   that we   have   not had time to explore together.
Please understand that the final due date is   firm,   and with   very   few   exceptions   we   are   unable   to   offer   extensions.   All late assignments will be   penalized -10   per   day.
Your final assignment will   include three sections of roughly equal   length   (i.e. your section   1   should   not   be substantially longer than sections 2 and 3), which   are   outlined   below.   In   addition   to   your   three sections, you must also include a works cited and the Statement of Originality.   Policy   memos should   be   properly formatted with   1   inch   margins,   12   point font (Times   New   Roman, Cambria, or similar),   in-text citations   in APA formats, and will   probably   be   between   1,500-2,500 words.
1. Policy Analysis: 
1.   Provide a   brief overview of the area of law and   how that   area   of   law   is   experienced   in   society   (e.g.   is   it the same for everyone? Why/why   not?)
2. You should   bring   in   relevant laws, court cases, policy   statements,   and   secondary   research   from         academics and journalists, etc. to   help us understand your area   of   law   as   it   is   experienced today.
3.   Note that you will likely   have to “narrow in” to smaller   areas   of your   policy topic   (e.g.   maybe   you’re   interested   in gender equality, but will study sex- and   gender-based violence,   harassment   and
discrimination in the context of higher education   in   particular).
2. Policy Proposals 
1.   Identify   potential   policy changes or social transformations. Consider questions like:
1. What specifically   needs to change, and at what levels   (international,   federal,代 写LSJ 200 Final Assignment Law & Society Policy MemoMatlab

2. Who   might   benefit   by your changes? Who   might be   harmed by your changes?   Who   are   the   winners and   losers?
3. What sorts of consequences can   you anticipate (positive   and   negative)?
4. What concerns might others raise   about your   proposed   changes?
3. Action Plan for Change 
1. Consider how we go from (A) the   status   quo   to   (B)   your   preferred   policy   changes.   What   needs   to
happen   between   A and   B? Your analysis should consider both “formal” and “informal”   means   for   advocating for change.
2.   Formal opportunities for change:
1.   Elections: what types of candidates need to be   supported?
2.   Legislation: who   has the   power to adopt legislative changes, and   how can   we   convince   them   to   do   so?
3.   Litigation: what opportunities are available to achieve some of these   policy victories   by   “suing”?
3.   Informal opportunities for change:
1. Civil Society: what civil society organizations exist,   or   need   to   develop,   to   support   advocacy   around your preferred   policy?
2. Social movements: are there opportunities for everyday   people to   try   and   influence   outcomes   in this   policy area? What social movement tactics might   be   helpful   for   advancing   this   vision?
1.   Protest:   might   protest   help   raise awareness or leverage enough   pressure on elected   officials?
2. Civil disobedience: are there unjust   laws that   ought to   be   challenged with   disobedience?
3. Social engagement: do we need to change   minds   and   hearts   to   build   political   support   for   your   preferred   policy vision?   How can we achieve that?
4. Works Cited 
5. Statement of Originality: To earn credit for this   assignment, you   must   copy   and   paste   the   following   statement into your document with your full name.
I, [FULL NAME], affirm that I worked hard on this. I   invested   in   my own   learning,   and   I   trusted   myself   to   navigate   resources and learn from   my   mistakes.   I   may   have asked a teacher,   librarian, writing   center      tutor, or even class peer for feedback or insight,   but   every word   of this   document   came from   my   own brain (or was otherwise properly attributed to the   original   author(s)).
I care about learning, even   if the assignments are   sometimes   boring,   and   I wouldn’t   insult   my   own intelligence   by using artificial   intelligence   programs,   paying for someone else to write on   my   behalf,   or   cheating from   past student work.   I understand that   if I am found   to   have   improperly   plagiarized   or otherwise violated this course’s academic conduct policy,   I will face   consequences   including   potentially failing   LSJ 200 and citations for academic   misconduct.   I also accept that   I   may   have   room   for improvement   in   my fully un-plagiarized submission, which   is   perfectly okay!   Even the   pros   need to   practice.
